Hi Charles and Sarah,

Attached are, (1) the Green's functions based on the new GNSS velocity file which inludes more sites, (2) the new GNSS velocity file. Please note that some of the sites (AN01 to AN20 except AN12) have not get permitted to be published till now even though I am allowed to use their data for some preliminary test. I include them here because we can easily exclude them in TDEFNODE while not re-calculating the Green's functions.

To extract the locations (lon, lat) of the GNSS sites, please use:
grep "^ "  dls2022_all.vel | awk '{print $1,$2}'

After our last meeting, I tried to run the test Charles suggested, that is, set the estimated parameters of model A to be the aprior parameter values of model B and check the difference between the estimated parameters of new model B and orginial model B. Unfortunately, I did NOT get same results (not the same misfit) which means one of the models may get stalled on the local minimum. I am going to write an email to Prof. McCaffery to see how to get rid of this.

Best,

Rui
