From Rui:
(1) To calcualte the green's functions with resolution of 1km*1km, run model 'py03' with the command:

    tdefnode pylith.tdfn py03

    Please note that I set the interation control command to be 'ic: 0' in this specific model so that no inversion will be performed.

NOTE:
I have created two versions of pylith.dfn:
pylith_shear.dfn:  In this case, no fault-normal dislocations are used for Anning-Zem.
pylith_3d.dfn:  In this case, fault-normal dislocations are used for Anning-Zem.

To use the different versions, first delete both the g11 directory and the py03 directory.
