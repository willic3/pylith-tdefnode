This directory contains reference information from TDefnode, for comparison
with PyLith results. The reference Green's functions may be computed in
directory g11 by running TDefnode.

From Rui:
(1) To calcualte the green's functions with resolution of 1km*1km, run model 'py03' with the command:

    tdefnode pylith.tdfn py03

    Please note that I set the interation control command to be 'ic: 0' in this specific model so that no inversion will be performed.

NOTE:
There is now just a single version of pylith.tdfn (with 3d slip for AZ fault), since that now seems
to work OK with modified version of py2def.py.
