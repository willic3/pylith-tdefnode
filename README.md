# Project: pylith-tdefnode
## This project is a collaboration between Dr. Rui Xu, Dr. Charles Williams, and Dr. D. Sarah Stamps to investigate the physics of faulting in the Daliangshan region of China.
### This package contains Python scripts to use the PyLith finite element code with the TDefnode geodetic inversion code. We use our recent work from the Daliangshan region of China as an example.

To test out this package, do the following:
1.  Move into the `src` directory and install the scripts: `pip install .`.
2.  Move into the `examples/daliangshan/pylith` directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.
