### This directory contains the site location information for the GNSS sites used in this study, a set of Green's functions generated by TDefnode for this study, and a TDefnode file desribing the fault geometries.

The GNSS sites used in this study are contained in 3 files (with some overlap between them):
1.  `dls2023_estnoise_eura14.sites`.
2.  `dls2022_all.vel`.
3.  `GNSS_sites_available.txt`.

To use these with PyLith, we combine them and convert to a local Transverse Mercator coordinate system:

`./get_coords.py`

This will produce both `.txt` and `.vtk` files for each data set in both WGS84 and local coordinates, as well as a set of files for the combined site coordinates.

This file also contains a set of TDefnode Green's functions in the `d22` directory, and the `py01.nod` file generated by TDefnode that defines the TDefnode fault geometries. These are used both in creating the PyLith meshes and generating the PyLith Green's functions.
